                COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges for families across the globe. UNICEF India has been a key
                partner in navigating this pandemic by providing families and caregivers with accurate and reliable
                information on the best
                ways to keep families safe.

              </p>
              <p>
                UNICEF India has translated the Parenting tip sheets into 10 languages and used them for capacity
                building within government systems through online training sessions, mainly focusing on Early Childhood
                Development (ECD) workers and caregivers. They transcripted these tips into a monthly calendar to be
                shared with parents along with training and
                informative activities. The tips were then developed into short videos that have been used on the
                Saathealth app. Additionally, UNICEF India shared the tips in approximately 70,000 WhatsApp groups,
                reaching an estimated million parents.
              </p>

              <p>
                The government has also been involved in sharing these tips on their websites and promoting them to
                parents, especially
                in rural villages.
              </p>
              UNICEF India has also launched the project ADAPT that focuses on adolescents, and has used the tips, with
              others, to create short videos that encourage intergenerational dialogue. They have since held multiple
              webinars with healthcare workers who have requested the tip sheets to print and display in their
              offices/surgeries.

                In the episode "A new age of parenting: where data matters", End
                Violence spoke with Dr Lucie Cluver, Professor of Child and
                Family Social Work at the University of Oxford and University of
                Cape Town, about evidence-based social interventions and how
                data can improve the lives of children and adolescents around
                the world. Dr. Cluver also talks about parenting as a key
                element for nurturing care and connection in children’s lives,
                especially during COVID-19, and shares useful parenting tips.

                There were maternity wards that transformed into ghost towns overnight, as visitor restrictions
                tightened and grandparents-to-be canceled flights. Schools closed, then reopened, only to close again,
                sending parents scrambling for child care, wrangling
                remote learners and struggling to do their own jobs. Millions of families lost income and many lost
                loved ones. For parents in particular, this year has meant recalibrating time and again. Yet, there was
                also joy — cobbled-together peaceful moments — amid a steady thrum of chaos, which isn’t letting up. We
                asked mothers and fathers across the country what parenting has been like for them during the pandemic
                and how, in their own ways, they have each learned to cope.
