        <h5> AUDIO PACK </h5>
        <div class="nav-card-item-content">
          <div data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <p>
              Our audio packs are sets of scripts of evidence-based messages for parents and caregivers that are shown
              to improve their mental health, give them positive ways to manage challenging child behaviour, and how to
              enjoy playing together. The scripts can be used in a variety of ways - for example, they can be read on
              radio, loudspeaker, video, or as a voice recording on text messages
            </p> <br>
            <p>
              The audio pack is broken down into three core modules; Play Together, Keep It Positive, and Sharing is
              Caring, each with six or seven related topics. Each topic comes with a ready-to-use script and a choice of
              three playful, practical activities that parents and caregivers can do with their children. There are also
              relaxation activities to support the mental health of adults.
            </p> <br>
            <h5>Who is this audio pack for? </h5>
            <p>The audio pack is primarily designed for government agencies and nongovernmental organizations that work
              to promote child and/or parent health and well-being. They may also be of interest to anyone who is
              concerned about the welfare of children in these challenging times. </p>
            <br>
            <h5>How can you use these audio scripts? </h5>
            <p>
              The content of the audio pack is open-source and free to use, adaptable for any context. The scripts and
              activities can be read out for a wide range of uses; such as radio or loudspeaker broadcast, or
              pre-recorded as voice notes to send via instant messaging. One complete module would take approximately 20
              minutes to broadcast. Each topic and activity would take approximately 3 minutes.
