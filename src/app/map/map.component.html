    <p>The COVID-19 Playful Parenting team's collaboration has brought together global agencies, governments,
        universities, NGOs, and community organisations to provide evidence-informed playful parenting resources to an
        unprecedented number of people in just a few months of intense work since the COVID-19 pandemic started.
            These impact stories reflect how the power of collective expertise and collaborative efforts help make a real
        difference in the lives of parents, caregivers and children! See our impact map below</p>
