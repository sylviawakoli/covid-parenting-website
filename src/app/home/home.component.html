    <h3>COVID-19: 24/7 PARENTING</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Evidence-based parenting tips available in more than 100 languages.</b>

      <p>
        Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) provides open-source and evidence-based parenting resources to support parents and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
        These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships and reducing violence against children by learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines, talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
     </p>
     <p>
      We are working with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, USAID, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Oxford University, the LEGO Foundation, the Internet of Good Things & many more, to keep children safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
