        The COVID-19 Parenting resources have now reached <span class="total-dissemination">0</span> people!
      </p> 
   
      <p>
        Our Partners have been incredibly supportive of the COVID-19 Playful Parenting Emergency Response Project!
      </p>     
      <p>
        Data on the number of beneficiaries who received the COVID-19 parenting resources is collected using social
        media metrics, Google analytics, reports from implementing agencies, surveys with organisations, and direct
        distribution. We also sent a short survey to over 600 implementing partners in approximately 187 countries who
        reported on the reach, adoption, and implementation of the resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        The overall reach is calculated by summing the total number of beneficiaries who receive the resources from each
        implementing partner regardless of implementation strategy. In order to avoid potential double counting, we use
        a conservative method to estimate the reach of social media platforms in alignment with technical guidance for
        supporting digital platforms and traditional media from UNICEF Risk Communication and Community Engagement
        COVID-19 Global Response. As a result, only one social media platform per implementing agency or data source was
        included in analyses, based on the platform with the highest reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        These resources focus on building positive parent-child relationships and reducing violence against children by
        learning through play, reinforcing positive and managing difficult behaviours, creating structure and routines,
        talking about COVID-19, keeping children safe online, and reducing stress and conflict.
